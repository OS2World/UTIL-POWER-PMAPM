PmApm source code package
-------------------------
Copyright (c) 1998 Cornelis BockemÅhl <cbockem@tiscali.ch>

After the program was released to the public as "freeware" in 1998 already (look
at http://hobbes.nmsu.edu), I am making this source code now (2003) also
available, since I am probably not going to do much with it any more. Anyway it
could be useful for others: Feel free to incorporate the code in any useful
program for the OS/2 users.

The program doesn't really do a lot: It only puts a PM interface on top of the
APM/2 tool by Roman Stangl. Anyway, for a programmer it might be of interest for
the following features:

- how to interface to a command line program that you start from a PM program
- how to write a program that consists only of a sequence of dialog windows
("wizard" style)
- a very simple and "hand made" method to provide support for several languages
using "message" files (.MSG).

The source code is commented a lot, but - sorry for the english speaking users!
- all in german.

The program is compiled and linked with "IBM VisualAge C/C++", version 3
